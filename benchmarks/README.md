# Million Benchmarks

These benchmarks are now 100% compliant with the [JS Framework Benchmark](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark).

[**→ View the official benchmark results**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS-zBSBzc0LW1V6BoPEw-V98P4_gox4qC0wZuQT5Yls_NDTDwM612aIYL_U988gfp4Xbl0ed7_9uYly/pubhtml)

Please note that Benchmark results are unstable. To have more stable results:

1. Restart OS. Do not run any applications. Put power cable to laptop.
2. Run tests 5 times.
3. Take the best result for each candidate.

> ## Original benchmark metrics
>
> The intention of these benchmarks are not to convince you that Million is faster that all libraries, but rather bring perspective on the results of a specific method of testing DOM manipulation implementations when compared to each other.
>
> Implementation may differ, as the goal of the benchmarks is to acheive the same function <u>for the end user</u>.
