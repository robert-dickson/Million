## What is Million?

Million is an extremely fast and lightweight (`<4kb`) virtual DOM that makes [React components](https://reactjs.org) up to [_**70% faster**_](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html).

> Oh man... Another [`/virtual dom|javascript/gi`](https://regexr.com/6mr5f) framework? I'm fine with [React](https://reactjs.org) already, why do I need this?

Million works with React. Million makes creating web apps just as easy (It's just wrapping a [React](https://reactjs.org) component!), but with faster rendering and loading speeds. By using a fine-tuned, optimized virtual DOM, Million.js reduces the overhead of React ([_try it out here_](https://demo.millionjs.org))

**TL;DR:** Imagine [React](https://reactjs.org/) components running at the speed of raw JavaScript.

## Installing Million

Inside your project directory, run the following command:

```sh
npm install million
```

## Example Usage

Million.js operates off of the concept of "blocks". Imagine blocks as special [Higher Order Components (HOCs)](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) that you use in your React application, but are rendered using the Million.js virtual DOM.

In order to create blocks from your components, all you'll need to is **wrap your components in a `block()` function**. Below is an example of a React "counter" component that's been wrapped with Million.js.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { block } from 'million/react';

function Counter({ initialCount }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);
  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>{count}</button>;
}

// Just wrap Counter in a block() function!
const CounterBlock = block(Counter);

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<CounterBlock />);
```

## Codebase

This repo is a "mono-repo" with modules. Million ships as one NPM package, but has first class modules for more complex, but important extensions. Each module has its own folder in the `/packages` directory.

You can also track our progress through our [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/aidenybai/projects/5/views/1?layout=roadmap).

## Acknowledgments

Million takes heavy inspiration from the following projects:

- [`blockdom`](https://github.com/ged-odoo/blockdom) ([G√©ry Debongnie](https://github.com/ged-odoo))
  Thank you to G√©ry pioneering the concept of "blocks" in the virtual DOM. Many parts of the Million.js codebase either directly or indirectly derive from his work.
- [`voby`](https://github.com/vobyjs/voby) ([Fabio Spampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato))
  The Million.js "template" concept is derived from Voby's `template()` API.
- [`bun`](https://bun.sh) for their homepage. The Million.js homepage is a remix of what they have currently.
- [`ivi`](https://github.com/localvoid/ivi), [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact), [and more](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/2021/table_chrome_96.0.4664.45.html)

Million is being used at companies like [Wyze](https://wyze.com) and [Dimension](https://dimension.dev), as well as open source work like [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), [TinyPages](https://github.com/Borrus-sudo/tinypages), [and more](https://github.com/aidenybai/million/network/dependents).
