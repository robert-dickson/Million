## What is Million?

Million is an extremely fast and lightweight (`<4kb`) virtual DOM that makes [React](https://reactjs.org) up to [_**70% faster**_](https://millionjs.org).

> Oh man... Another [`/virtual dom|javascript/gi`](https://regexr.com/6mr5f) library? I'm fine with [React](https://reactjs.org) already, why should I need it?

Million makes creating user interfaces as easy (It's just [React](https://reactjs.org)!), but with faster rendering and loading speeds. By using a fine-tuned, optimized virtual DOM, Million.js reduces the overhead of the React Reconciler.

Furthermore, while alternative libraries like [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) reduce bundle sizes via efficient code design, Million.js can be used inside [React](https://reactjs.org) and is much faster than Preact.

**TL;DR:** Imagine [React](https://preactjs.com/) at the speed of raw JavaScript.

## Installing Million

Inside your project directory, run the following command:

```sh
npm install million
```

## Codebase

This repo is a "mono-repo" with modules. Million ships as one NPM package, but has first class modules for more complex, but important extensions. Each module has its own folder in the `/packages` directory.

You can also track our progress through our [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/aidenybai/projects/5/views/1?layout=roadmap).

## Acknowledgments

Million takes heavy inspiration from the following projects:

- [`blockdom`](https://github.com/ged-odoo/blockdom) ([GÃ©ry Debongnie](https://github.com/ged-odoo))
  Thank you to GÃ©ry pioneering the concept of "blocks" in the virtual DOM. Many parts of the Million.js codebase either directly or indirectly derive from his work.

- [`voby`](https://github.com/vobyjs/voby) ([Fabio Spampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato))
  The Million.js "template" concept is derived from Voby's `template()` API.

- [`bun`](https://bun.sh) for their homepage. The Million.js homepage is a remix of what they have currently.

- [`ivi`](https://github.com/localvoid/ivi), [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact), [and more](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/2021/table_chrome_96.0.4664.45.html)

Million is being used at companies like [Wyze](https://wyze.com) and [Dimension](https://dimension.dev), as well as open source work like [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), [TinyPages](https://github.com/Borrus-sudo/tinypages), [and more](https://github.com/aidenybai/million/network/dependents).
