# Optimizing Compiler

<Callout>
  This is an experimental feature. It is not recommended to use this in
  production.
</Callout>

Million.js has an optimizing compiler that can be used to optimize block initialization. It current supports [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org), and [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) through [`unplugin`](https://github.com/unjs/unplugin).

You can import based on needs like so:

```js
import { vite, webpack, rollup, esbuild } from 'million/compiler';
```

## Vite

```js
// vite.config.js
import * as million from 'million/compiler';
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [million.vite()],
});
```

## Webpack

```js
// webpack.config.js
import * as million from 'million/compiler';

export default {
  plugins: [million.webpack()],
};
```

## Rollup

```js
// rollup.config.js
import * as million from 'million/compiler';

export default {
  plugins: [UnpluginFeature.rollup()],
};
```

## ESBuild

```js
// esbuild.config.js
import { build } from 'esbuild';
import * as million from 'million/compiler';

build({
  plugins: [million.esbuild()],
});
```
