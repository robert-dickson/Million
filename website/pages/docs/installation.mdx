import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout';

# Installation

Inside your project directory, run the following command:

```sh
npm install million
```

Or with `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add million
```

If you want to just play around with Million, you can use a Skypack import:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { m, render } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/million';

  // your code here
</script>
```
