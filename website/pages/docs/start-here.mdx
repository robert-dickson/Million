Million is a lightweight (`<1kb`) Virtual DOM. It's [_**really fast**_](https://millionjs.org/benchmarks) and makes it easy to create user interfaces.

> Oh man... Another [`/virtual dom|javascript/gim`](https://regexr.com/6mr5f) library? I'm fine with [React](https://reactjs.org) already, why should I bother switching?

Million makes creating user interfaces as easy as [React](https://reactjs.org), but with faster performance and smaller bundle size for the end user. By computing the user interface beforehand with a compiler, Million reduces the overhead of traditional Virtual DOM.

> Okay cool... but why should I use Million if I can just use [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) if I need something a bit more lightweight?

While alternative libraries like [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) reduce bundle sizes by efficient code design, Million takes it a step further by **leveraging compilation** to make a quantum leap in improving bundle size **and** render speed.

Think of it as if [React](https://preactjs.com/)'s API and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)'s compiler had a baby. [A baby with _**super speed! ðŸ‘¶**_](https://millionjs.org/benchmarks)

## Our First Application

Open this [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/aidenybai/million-react?file=src%2FApp.jsx) or clone this [repo](https://github.com/aidenybai/million-react) to get started.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/aidenybai/million-react?file=src%2FApp.jsx)

Navigate to `src/App.jsx` and you should see this:

<br />
<iframe
  style={{ width: '100%', height: '69vh' }}
  src="https://stackblitz.com/github/aidenybai/million-react?file=src%2FApp.jsx&embed=1&hideExplorer=1&hidedevtools=1&devtoolsheight=0"
></iframe>

Open the StackBlitz preview (should be at `XXXXXXXXXXX-local.webcontainer.io`), if you see content and you're able to interact with it, you're ready to rumble!

Within the `src/App.jsx` file, you can write any React code with some [limitations](https://github.com/aidenybai/million-react#limitations). If you are unfamiliar with React, you can learn more about it [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

Million does not depend on React, but it does use aliases so that any import from `react` is automatically aliased to `million`. This means that you can use any React library with Million without any changes, and you can drop Million into any React Vite project and have it instantly work.

Happy Coding!
