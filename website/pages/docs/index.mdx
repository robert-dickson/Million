# Million.js

**Million.js** is an extremely fast and lightweight (`<4kb`) virtual DOM that makes [React components](https://react.dev) up to [**70% faster**](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html).

> Oh man... Another [`/virtual dom|javascript/gi`](https://regexr.com/6mr5f) framework? I'm fine with [React](https://reactjs.org) already, why do I need this?

Million works with React. Million makes creating web apps just as easy (It's just wrapping a [React](https://react.dev) component!), but with faster rendering and loading speeds. By using a fine-tuned, optimized virtual DOM, Million.js reduces the overhead of React ([_try it out here_](https://demo.million.dev))

  **TL;DR:** Imagine [React](https://react.dev) components running at the speed
  of raw JavaScript.

## Acknowledgments

Million takes heavy inspiration from the following projects:

- [`blockdom`](https://github.com/ged-odoo/blockdom) ([Géry Debongnie](https://github.com/ged-odoo))
  Thank you to Géry pioneering the concept of "blocks" in the virtual DOM. Many parts of the Million.js codebase either directly or indirectly derive from his work.
- [`voby`](https://github.com/vobyjs/voby) ([Fabio Spampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato))
  The Million.js "template" concept is derived from Voby's `template()` API.
- [`bun`](https://bun.sh) for their homepage.
- [`react`](https://react.dev) and [`turbo`](https://turbo.build) for their documentation. Many parts of the current Million.js documentation are grokked and modified from theirs.
- [`ivi`](https://github.com/localvoid/ivi), [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact), [and more](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/2021/table_chrome_96.0.4664.45.html)

Million is being used at companies like [Wyze](https://wyze.com) and [Dimension](https://dimension.dev), as well as open source work like [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), [TinyPages](https://github.com/Borrus-sudo/tinypages), [and more](https://github.com/aidenybai/million/network/dependents).
