# What is Million.js?

Million is an extremely fast and lightweight (`<4kb`) virtual DOM that makes [React components](https://reactjs.org) up to [_**65% faster**_](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html).

> Oh man... Another [`/virtual dom|javascript/gi{:js}`](https://regexr.com/6mr5f) framework? I'm fine with [React](https://reactjs.org) already, why do I need this?

Million makes creating user interfaces as easy (It's just [React](https://reactjs.org)!), but with faster rendering and loading speeds. By using a fine-tuned, optimized virtual DOM, Million.js reduces the overhead of the React Reconciler.

Furthermore, while alternative libraries like [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) reduce bundle sizes via efficient code design, Million.js can be used inside [React](https://reactjs.org) and is much faster than Preact.

## React vs. Million.js

The following example is a simple counter app that uses React and Million.js. The code is identical, but the performance is different.

## What is a virtual DOM?

A virtual DOM a concept that allows you to create user interfaces declaratively, without having to directly manipulate the DOM. Instead, you create a virtual representation of the DOM, and the virtual DOM library will take care of updating the actual DOM for you.

The virtual DOM is used by many popular libraries, including [React](https://reactjs.org), [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), and [Vue](https://vuejs.org). However, it suffers from [performance overhead](https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead), often making it impractical for highly interactive runtime applications.

Million.js is a underlying runtime for virtual DOM based frameworks. The long-term goal is to serve as a faithful partner to existing frameworks, allowing them to be faster and more lightweight without migrating your entire project to a new framework.

  Thank you to Géry pioneering the concept of "blocks" in the virtual DOM. Many parts of the Million.js codebase either directly or indirectly derive from his work.

  The Million.js "template" concept is derived from Voby's `template()` API.
