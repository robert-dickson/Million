# What is Million.js?

Million is an extremely fast and lightweight (`<4kb`) virtual DOM that makes [React components](https://react.dev) up to [_**70% faster**_](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html).

> Oh man... Another [`/virtual dom|javascript/gi{:js}`](https://regexr.com/6mr5f) framework? I'm fine with [React](https://react.dev) already, why do I need this?

Million works with React. Million makes creating web apps just as easy (It's just wrapping a [React](https://react.dev) component!), but with faster rendering and loading speeds. By using a fine-tuned, optimized virtual DOM, Million.js reduces the overhead of React.

  Imagine [React](https://react.dev) components running at the speed of raw
  JavaScript.

## React Virtual DOM vs. Million.js

The following example is a simple counter app that uses React and Million.js. The code is identical, but the performance is different.

  Thank you to Géry pioneering the concept of "blocks" in the virtual DOM. Many parts of the Million.js codebase either directly or indirectly derive from his work.

  The Million.js "template" concept is derived from Voby's `template()` API.
