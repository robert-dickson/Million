# What is Million.js?

Million is an extremely fast and lightweight (`<4kb`) virtual DOM that makes [React components](https://reactjs.org) up to [_**70% faster**_](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html).

> Oh man... Another [`/virtual dom|javascript/gi{:js}`](https://regexr.com/6mr5f) framework? I'm fine with [React](https://reactjs.org) already, why do I need this?

Million works with React. Million makes creating web apps just as easy (It's just wrapping a [React](https://reactjs.org) component!), but with faster rendering and loading speeds. By using a fine-tuned, optimized virtual DOM, Million.js reduces the overhead of React.

## React Virtual DOM vs. Million.js

The following example is a simple counter app that uses React and Million.js. The code is identical, but the performance is different.

## How does it work?

A virtual DOM one methodology to create user interfaces declaratively, while efficiently manipulating the DOM. Instead, you create a virtual representation of the DOM, and the virtual DOM library will take care of updating the actual DOM for you.

The virtual DOM is used by many popular libraries, including [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Preact](https://preactjs.com/). However, it suffers from [performance overhead](https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead), making it less efficient.

Below you can see here the "diff" algorithm needs to check against every node in the tree in order to make one simple change.

<div className="flex justify-center my-3">
  <Image
    src="/vdom-diff.svg"
    alt="Hello"
    width={700}
    height={500}
    className="rounded-lg shadow"
  />
</div>

Comparatively, Million.js uses a "block" virtual DOM. It achieves this by statically analyzing JSX and creating a "mapping" between the props and the DOM. This allows Million.js to skip the diffing step and directly update the DOM after dirty checking the props.

<div className="flex justify-center my-3">
  <Image
    src="/block-diff.svg"
    alt="Hello"
    width={700}
    height={500}
    className="rounded-lg shadow"
  />
</div>

By keeping the update step minimal with a small block tree and direct mappings to the DOM, Million.js can achieve fast benchmarks on the [JS Framework Benchmark](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html). The long-term goal is to serve as a faithful partner to existing frameworks (_like React_), allowing them to be faster and more lightweight without migrating your entire project to a new framework.

  Thank you to Géry pioneering the concept of "blocks" in the virtual DOM. Many parts of the Million.js codebase either directly or indirectly derive from his work.

  The Million.js "template" concept is derived from Voby's `template()` API.
